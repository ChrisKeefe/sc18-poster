## Abstract
We demonstrate the ways in which automatic, integrated,
decentralized provenance tracking in QIIME 2, a leading
microbiome bioinformatics platform, enables reproducible
microbiome science. We use sample data from a recent
study of arid soil microbiomes ([Significant Impacts of
Increasing Aridity on the Arid Soil Microbiome]; Neilson et
al, 2017[2]), to illustrate specific analyses that QIIME 2
supports, and to frame our discussion of the QIIME 2
platform.

QIIME 2 actions yield as outputs Artifacts integrating the
requested data or visualization with comprehensive data
provenance that describes the computational history of
that data or visualization, including all methods and
parameters involved in its creation. This approach gives
users, reviewers, and readers powerful tools for
understanding, reproducing, and extending studies.
The benefits this approach provides to both the researcher
and the scientific community are significant, and provide a
useful model for research software developers across
disciplines.

Raw data and taxonomic classifier files available on request.

## Dependencies

* A TeX installation that includes [LuaTeX]
* LaTeX package dependencies including beamerposter (these usually come with
  your TeX installation, but if not, you can get them from [CTAN])
* [Raleway] and [Lato], which are both available under Open Font License

## Usage

1. Copy the files in this repository (or clone the repository)

1. Navigate into your local poster directory and run `make` to build the poster

1. `make clean` will delete all build-related files including the poster, allowing you to re-run `make` as needed.
